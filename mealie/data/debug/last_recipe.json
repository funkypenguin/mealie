    "articleBody": "Leftover rice is ideal for this dish (and a great way to use up any takeout that\u2019s hanging around), since fully chilled rice tends to be drier and will become crispier and browner in the skillet. To get the best texture, evenly distribute the rice in your pan and gently press down to flatten it out like a pancake. Don\u2019t touch until you hear it crackle! Finish with a sunny-side-up egg\u2014or poach it if you don't mind the stovetop fuss. This recipe is part of the 2021\u00a0Feel Good Food Plan, our eight-day dinner plan for starting the year off right.",
