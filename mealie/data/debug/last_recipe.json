While your chicken is getting toasty in the oven, make your chile crisp-inspired dressing with garlic, paprika, cracked coriander, and red pepper flakes. If you have leftovers (or want to make extra for a bit of meal prep), keep all of your ingredients separate in the fridge so that they stay fresher for longer. \u00a0This recipe is part of the 2021\u00a0Feel Good Food Plan, our eight-day dinner plan for starting the year off right.",
