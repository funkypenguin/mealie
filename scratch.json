This Detroit-style pizza from Bryan Ford, which uses a half-batch of his Master Dough, is perfect for beginners because you don’t have to shape the dough or wrangle a hot pizza stone. If you don’t have a Detroit pizza pan (its deep sides and black anodized aluminum help achieve a crust that’s fluffy on the inside but crisp all around), that’s okay: Use a 13x9\" baking pan or two 8x8\" baking pans.",
